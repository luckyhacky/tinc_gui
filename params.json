Find more information at http://www.tinc-vpn.org.\r\n\r\nTinc GUI for Android is a [(slightly modified)](https://github.com/Vilbrekin/tinc) cross-compiled version of tincd for Arm, associated with a basic GUI for daemon management.\r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\nAs this is a simple GUI around the original tincd daemon, please refer to the [official documentation](http://www.tinc-vpn.org/documentation/tinc_4.html#Configuration) for the configuration.\r\n\r\nThe easiest solution is to build your configuration and store it on your external SD card.\r\nBecause Android devices usually mount it with noexec flag, a new option has been added to tinc's configuration file, in order to specify the script interpreter to use for configuration scripts (instead of having them executable):\r\n```\r\n# Use sh to execute all configuration scripts\r\nScriptsInterpreter = /system/bin/sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n### Why does this application need SuperUser rights?\r\nIt doesn't really need them by itself (there's an option to disable it).\r\nHowever tincd daemon will most probably need super user rights to work properly: access to TUN/TAP device is usually restricted to root.\r\n\r\n### What are the supported CPU architectures?\r\nARM only for the time being.\r\n\r\n### Is it working?\r\nVery well on my SGS2 i9100, under CyanogenMod 9. \r\nWaiting for more feedback.\r\n\r\n### Is it free?\r\nYes, it's even released under GPLv3.
